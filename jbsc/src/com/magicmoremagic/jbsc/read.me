/*

SqlIndices are always 0-based.  When used as parameters for queries, 1 is added
to the indices to properly make the first parameter have an index 1. 

Any ColTypes appearing directly in a FieldList defining an aggregate type,
field set, or function parameter list will automatically be treated as "meta".
